make the ball bounce on the table
I think ill make the ball grow slightly and shrink to show the height
I should also add a shadow shape to the ball.
ill make the game lose based on the rules of ping pong.
if the ball bounces on the floor = loss.
i could also try making a hit and run animation for the players
i could make player 2 have a different shirt and also flip the image
make the speed increase over time
could also make shots "attackable" if the timing is poor, the return will be slow but the next hit from opp with be fast.
