modify the collision and drawing so the upperbody/lowerbody can be pushed under/towards the table.
add sliding collision so you dont get stuck on the table
ill make the game lose based on the rules of ping pong.
 - serve bounces twice on table
 - if ball bounces
  - last hitter gets point if ball bounced once on table already
  - not last hitter gets point if ball did not bounce once on table
  - server switches every two points
if the ball bounces on the floor = loss.
i could also try making a hit and run animation for the players
i could make player 2 have a different shirt and also flip the image
could also make shots "attackable" if the timing is poor, the return will be slow but the next hit from opp with be fast.
